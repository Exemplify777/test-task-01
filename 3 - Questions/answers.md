## Questions

  **Q:** What are requirements and where do I find them?  
  **A:** Requirements are the documentation of the expected criteria for the software to be developed. According to the requirements, the final software should have the required functionality and be ready for usage. Generally, the requirements can be either business or system requirements. There can also be other types of requirements. For example the business requirements are prepared by the product owners or business analysts so that they can provide the actual version of the requirements. Also requirements can be written as epic and stories in terms of Agile methodology and stored in software development management tools such as Jira, and knowledge base systems such as Confluence, or sometimes they can be found as files in the project source code repository.   

  **Q:** What is the difference between a build and a release?  
  **A:** A build is a built version of an application from any state of the source code. A release is a built version of that state of the source code in which the requirements of the planned release have been implemented, tested, and ready for production deployment.  

  **Q:** How can QA engineers affect quality?  
  **A:** QA engineers are directly responsible for product quality. It is their responsibility to verify that all functionality of the software works as described in the software requirements. They organize their work by planning testing in such a way that the test covers the maximum number of cases which may contain possible bugs in the software application. After performing all the actions according to the test plan and fixing the found bugs, the product acquires the required quality.
